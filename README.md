So I am attempting to make a scheduling website using NodeJS and EJS, however the issue I am having is that when pulling information from the Mysql database
(I'm using Heroku to host and Heroku's DBClear for the database) the string always returns as undefined. Currently there's a separate error that arose during my attempts
to fix the original issue but I am not sure what else I can try to fix it. I'm sure it's something simple that I'm missing but I've tried everything I can think of
currently.

Thank you for reading!
